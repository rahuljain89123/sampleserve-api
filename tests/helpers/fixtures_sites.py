Impacted soil was observed in the vicinity of the diesel tank submersible pump outlet. The spill containment boots around the USTs were tested by filling with water and checking for water loss approximately 1 hour later and again 24 hours later. On May 17, 2005, at 3:00 p.m. the spill containment boot around the premium unleaded tank was found to be leaking. Based upon this inspection, at approximately 2:00 pm on May 18, 2005, Total personnel upgraded the suspected release to a confirmed release.</p>\r\n<p>The following tanks are currently in service at this facility.<br />\r\nTank # Tank Size &amp; Type Contents Age (years)<br />\r\n1 12,000 - steel Prem. unleaded gasoline 14<br />\r\n2 12,000 - steel Reg. unleaded gasoline 14<br />\r\n3 6,000 - steel Mid. unleaded gasoline 14<br />\r\n4 6,000 - steel Diesel 14</p>\r\n<p>During the subsequent initial investigation, free product was not identified; however, hydrocarbon impact was evident in several locations.</p>\r\n<p><b>Surrounding Populations</b></p>\r\n<p>The facility is located on the southeast corner of the intersection of M-100 and U.S. 100 in the town of Your Town, Michigan. The station is adjacent to a Bank and a real estate office to the west and a private residential home to the south. Across U.S. 100 to the southwest is a Gasoline Station with another real estate office and private residential home located to the north. To the northwest, across the intersection of U.S. 100 and M-100, is a third real estate office. The \'Tasty\' restaurant is located directly north of the real estate office. Immediately north of the Site Station, across M-100 is a Bank, beyond which is a residential home just north of the bank.</p>\r\n<p>Land use in the immediate vicinity is predominately commercial with some residential, with the business district centered around the intersection of M-100 and U.S. 100. The local Township consists of 18,207 residents.</p>\r\n<p><b>Lithology/Water Quality</b></p>\r\n<p>The subject site lies in a gently rolling topographically hilly area. The groundwater at the site is approximately 10 - 12 feet below the grade. Groundwater flow direction is west towards Big Happy Lake, approximately 1,000 feet away.</p>\r\n<p>Domestic water in the vicinity of the Township is supplied by private individual drinking water wells. The nearest drinking water well services the facility and is located approximately 10 feet from the UST system. This well has been tested for benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylene (BTEX), methyl-tert-butyl-ether (MTBE), and polynuclear aromatic compounds (PNAs). These compounds are not present in water samples from this well. The screened interval for this drinking water well is located below a significant confining clay layer, which extends from 25 feet to 48 feet below grade (Refer to Well Logs). This confining clay layer is evident throughout the entire area with most wells screened below this layer.</p>\r\n<p>A water sample was collected from the station\'s water supply well in June of 2005. This sample was collected and submitted under chain-of-custody documentation and analyzed for BTEX, using U.S.EPA Method 602; PNAs, using U.S.EPA Method 8310; and MTBE, using U.S.EPA modified Method 602. Results of this analysis indicate that the sample was non-detect for all parameters.<br />\r\nClimate</p>\r\n<p>The climate for the Township is moderate with average annual precipitation of 29 inches, and average annual temperature of 58 degrees Fahrenheit. According to the County Soil Survey, because the county lies close to the Great Lakes, westerly winds pass over the lake before reaching the county, resulting in a quasi-maritime to continental climate. As a result of the prevailing westerly winds and this lake effect, winter is milder and summer is cooler than average for the Midwest.</p>\r\n<p><u><b>HYDROGEOLOGICAL INVESTIGATION METHODOLOGIES</b></u></p>\r\n<p>This hydrogeological investigation as conducted can be divided into the following four phases:</p>\r\n<p>1) Soil investigation;<br />\r\n2) Geoprobe investigation;<br />\r\n3) Monitoring well installation; and<br />\r\n4) Report preparation.</p>\r\n<p><b>Soil Investigation</b></p>\r\n<p>In November and December of 2005, in an attempt to delineate the extent of soil contamination around the point of release, 20 soil borings were advanced in the vicinity of the USTs and the failed containment boot. Each soil sample was field screened using a photoionization detector (PID). Eight selected soil samples collected at multiple depths and locations around point of release were submitted for analysis (Refer to &quot;Update Report&quot; dated March 25, 2006).</p>\r\n<p>Analytical results from all soil samples submitted for analysis were non-detect for BTEX, MTBE, and PNAs. Concentrations of lead were all within normal background levels for the region and below current Michigan Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ) Generic criteria level for lead.<br />\r\nGeoprobe Investigation</p>\r\n<p>In July 2006, 20 discrete groundwater samples were collected using a GeoProbe &reg; Multimedia Sampling System (Geoprobe), operated by GeoProbe Drilling Company, Inc. of Sometown, Michigan. Groundwater samples were collected from 20 discrete sample points and monitoring wells MW-1 through MW-3. The purpose of the sampling was to delineate the horizontal and vertical extent of groundwater impact and to verify site lithology.</p>\r\n<p>The first objective of the investigation was to determine the horizontal extent of the groundwater impact. This was accomplished by collecting groundwater samples from approximately six inches to one foot below the groundwater interface and analyzing the samples using an on-site mobile laboratory. Once the horizontal extent of the BTEX impact was delineated, the vertical extent of the contaminant plume was defined at; two locations along the axis of the plume (refer to ESI Report dated August 16, 2006, GP-11 and GP-16 locations). The vertical extent was defined by collecting water samples at ten-foot intervals, from each location, until two consecutive samples indicated non-detect for BTEX.</p>\r\n<p>All samples were collected in laboratory supplied sample containers and analyzed for BTEX using U.S. EPA Method 8020. This analysis was conducted on-site by a mobile laboratory. Select samples were submitted under chain-of-custody documentation to Laboratory in Sometown for analysis of dissolved lead using U.S. EPA Method 7421.</p>\r\n<p><b>Monitoring Well Installation</b></p>\r\n<p>On January 5, 2005, Consultant, Inc. installed six monitoring wells down gradient of the site to determine site hydrogeology. Each well was installed by the hollow stem auger method of drilling and constructed according to EPA recommended protocol outlined in the Groundwater Monitoring Technical Enforcement Guidance Document (TEGD). Each well was advanced to the first water-bearing zone encountered, at approximately 4 to 7 feet below grade. Well materials included: 5 feet of, #10 slot, two-inch diameter PVC screen installed to intersect the groundwater interface zone, solid PVC casing from top of screen to surface, medium-grained silica sand pack extending two feet above top of screen, capped by bentonite to the surface. Flush mount well protectors were then cemented in place to protect the wells and provide access. Each monitoring well was then immediately developed.</p>\r\n<p>On January 19, 2007, the monitoring wells were sampled by Consultant, Inc. personnel. Three to five well volumes were evacuated prior to sampling each well. This was accomplished using dedicated disposable PVC bailers and line. All samples were collected and submitted under chain-of-custody documentation and analyzed for BTEX, using U.S.EPA Method 8020. All samples were shipped on ice to Lab Analytical in Thattown, Michigan for analysis.</p>\r\n<p>Results of analysis revealed that monitoring wells, MW-2, MW-3, and MW-6A, were each above criteria for BTEX compounds and MW-2, MW-3, and MW-4 were above for dissolved lead. MW-4 was above MDEQ criteria for dissolved lead but not for BTEX compounds. All remaining monitoring well were non-detect for all compounds sampled for (refer to Table B for summary of analytical results and Appendix B for copies of analytical reports).</p>\r\n<p>On March 22, 1994, Consultant, Inc. installed three additional wells at the site, MW-10A, MW-10B, and MW-6B. These wells were installed to further identify the site hydrogeology and to monitor vertical migration of contaminants (refer to Figure 3 for locations). Each well was installed by the hollow stem auger method of drilling and constructed according to EPA recommended protocol outlined in the Groundwater Monitoring Technical Enforcement Guidance Document (TEGD). Well materials included: 5 feet of, #10 slot, two-inch diameter PVC screen, solid PVC casing from top of screen to surface, medium-grained silica sand pack extending two feet above top of screen, capped by bentonite to the surface. Flush mount well protectors were then cemented in place to protect the wells and provide access. Each monitoring well was then immediately developed.</p>\r\n<p><u><b>RESULTS</b></u></p>\r\n<p><b>Geology</b></p>\r\n<p>Soil samples were collected throughout the site to document the lithology of the subsurface materials. The sediments encountered on-site were consistent throughout the site. Generally, the sediments underlying the site consist of approximately one foot of top soil followed predominantly by medium-grained sand to a depth of approximately 25.5 feet below grade where a tan clay layer was encountered. This confining clay layer is believed to be continuous across the site. This conclusion is confirmed by several drinking water well boring logs obtained for facilities near the site (refer to Appendix A for boring logs).</p>\r\n<p><b>Hydrogeology</b></p>\r\n<p>On March 30, 2007, all groundwater monitor wells were surveyed for top of casing (TOC) and referenced to an on-site benchmark. The well coordinates were then plotted on a base map. Static water level measurements, to the nearest 0.01 foot were obtained using a water interface probe. Groundwater elevations were calculated for each well, and groundwater flow direction and gradient at the site were determined. Based on measurements obtained at the site on January 16, 2007 and again on March 30, 2007 groundwater is flowing to the west/southwest at a gradient of approximately 0.60 feet per 100 feet or 0.60 percent.</p>\r\n<p><b>Soil Quality</b></p>\r\n<p>Soil samples collected at multiple depths and locations in and around the area of the failed containment boot indicates that soil contamination associated with this release is limited. Analytical results from all soil samples collected were non-detect for BTEX, MTBE, and PNAs. Total lead results from all soil samples were below current MDEQ criteria and within normal background ranges for the region. (refer to Update Report dated March 25, 2005).<br />\r\nGroundwater Quality</p>\r\n<p>Twelve monitoring wells have been installed at 10 separate locations at and downgradient from the site. Results of analysis of groundwater collected from these wells revealed that monitoring wells, MW-2, MW-3, and MW-6A, were each above MDEQ criteria for BTEX compounds and MW-2, MW-3, and MW-4 were above MDEQ criteria for dissolved lead. MW-4 was above MDEQ criteria for dissolved lead only. All remaining monitoring wells were non-detect for all compounds sampled. Based on vertical profiling sampling from both the Geoprobe investigation phase and the monitoring well installation phase, groundwater contamination appears to be limited to the upper 10 feet of the aquifer.</p>','','',0,0,'','','',0,0,'','','',0,0,'','',0,0,'','',0,0,'','',None),

Impacted soil was observed in the vicinity of the diesel tank submersible pump outlet. The spill containment boots around the USTs were tested by filling with water and checking for water loss approximately 1 hour later and again 24 hours later. On May 17, 2005, at 3:00 p.m. the spill containment boot around the premium unleaded tank was found to be leaking. Based upon this inspection, at approximately 2:00 pm on May 18, 2005, Total personnel upgraded the suspected release to a confirmed release.</p>\r\n<p>The following tanks are currently in service at this facility.<br />\r\nTank # Tank Size &amp; Type Contents Age (years)<br />\r\n1 12,000 - steel Prem. unleaded gasoline 14<br />\r\n2 12,000 - steel Reg. unleaded gasoline 14<br />\r\n3 6,000 - steel Mid. unleaded gasoline 14<br />\r\n4 6,000 - steel Diesel 14</p>\r\n<p>During the subsequent initial investigation, free product was not identified; however, hydrocarbon impact was evident in several locations.</p>\r\n<p><b>Surrounding Populations</b></p>\r\n<p>The facility is located on the southeast corner of the intersection of M-100 and U.S. 100 in the town of Your Town, Michigan. The station is adjacent to a Bank and a real estate office to the west and a private residential home to the south. Across U.S. 100 to the southwest is a Gasoline Station with another real estate office and private residential home located to the north. To the northwest, across the intersection of U.S. 100 and M-100, is a third real estate office. The \'Tasty\' restaurant is located directly north of the real estate office. Immediately north of the Site Station, across M-100 is a Bank, beyond which is a residential home just north of the bank.</p>\r\n<p>Land use in the immediate vicinity is predominately commercial with some residential, with the business district centered around the intersection of M-100 and U.S. 100. The local Township consists of 18,207 residents.</p>\r\n<p><b>Lithology/Water Quality</b></p>\r\n<p>The subject site lies in a gently rolling topographically hilly area. The groundwater at the site is approximately 10 - 12 feet below the grade. Groundwater flow direction is west towards Big Happy Lake, approximately 1,000 feet away.</p>\r\n<p>Domestic water in the vicinity of the Township is supplied by private individual drinking water wells. The nearest drinking water well services the facility and is located approximately 10 feet from the UST system. This well has been tested for benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylene (BTEX), methyl-tert-butyl-ether (MTBE), and polynuclear aromatic compounds (PNAs). These compounds are not present in water samples from this well. The screened interval for this drinking water well is located below a significant confining clay layer, which extends from 25 feet to 48 feet below grade (Refer to Well Logs). This confining clay layer is evident throughout the entire area with most wells screened below this layer.</p>\r\n<p>A water sample was collected from the station\'s water supply well in June of 2005. This sample was collected and submitted under chain-of-custody documentation and analyzed for BTEX, using U.S.EPA Method 602; PNAs, using U.S.EPA Method 8310; and MTBE, using U.S.EPA modified Method 602. Results of this analysis indicate that the sample was non-detect for all parameters.<br />\r\nClimate</p>\r\n<p>The climate for the Township is moderate with average annual precipitation of 29 inches, and average annual temperature of 58 degrees Fahrenheit. According to the County Soil Survey, because the county lies close to the Great Lakes, westerly winds pass over the lake before reaching the county, resulting in a quasi-maritime to continental climate. As a result of the prevailing westerly winds and this lake effect, winter is milder and summer is cooler than average for the Midwest.</p>\r\n<p><u><b>HYDROGEOLOGICAL INVESTIGATION METHODOLOGIES</b></u></p>\r\n<p>This hydrogeological investigation as conducted can be divided into the following four phases:</p>\r\n<p>1) Soil investigation;<br />\r\n2) Geoprobe investigation;<br />\r\n3) Monitoring well installation; and<br />\r\n4) Report preparation.</p>\r\n<p><b>Soil Investigation</b></p>\r\n<p>In November and December of 2005, in an attempt to delineate the extent of soil contamination around the point of release, 20 soil borings were advanced in the vicinity of the USTs and the failed containment boot. Each soil sample was field screened using a photoionization detector (PID). Eight selected soil samples collected at multiple depths and locations around point of release were submitted for analysis (Refer to &quot;Update Report&quot; dated March 25, 2006).</p>\r\n<p>Analytical results from all soil samples submitted for analysis were non-detect for BTEX, MTBE, and PNAs. Concentrations of lead were all within normal background levels for the region and below current Michigan Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ) Generic criteria level for lead.<br />\r\nGeoprobe Investigation</p>\r\n<p>In July 2006, 20 discrete groundwater samples were collected using a GeoProbe &reg; Multimedia Sampling System (Geoprobe), operated by GeoProbe Drilling Company, Inc. of Sometown, Michigan. Groundwater samples were collected from 20 discrete sample points and monitoring wells MW-1 through MW-3. The purpose of the sampling was to delineate the horizontal and vertical extent of groundwater impact and to verify site lithology.</p>\r\n<p>The first objective of the investigation was to determine the horizontal extent of the groundwater impact. This was accomplished by collecting groundwater samples from approximately six inches to one foot below the groundwater interface and analyzing the samples using an on-site mobile laboratory. Once the horizontal extent of the BTEX impact was delineated, the vertical extent of the contaminant plume was defined at; two locations along the axis of the plume (refer to ESI Report dated August 16, 2006, GP-11 and GP-16 locations). The vertical extent was defined by collecting water samples at ten-foot intervals, from each location, until two consecutive samples indicated non-detect for BTEX.</p>\r\n<p>All samples were collected in laboratory supplied sample containers and analyzed for BTEX using U.S. EPA Method 8020. This analysis was conducted on-site by a mobile laboratory. Select samples were submitted under chain-of-custody documentation to Laboratory in Sometown for analysis of dissolved lead using U.S. EPA Method 7421.</p>\r\n<p><b>Monitoring Well Installation</b></p>\r\n<p>On January 5, 2005, Consultant, Inc. installed six monitoring wells down gradient of the site to determine site hydrogeology. Each well was installed by the hollow stem auger method of drilling and constructed according to EPA recommended protocol outlined in the Groundwater Monitoring Technical Enforcement Guidance Document (TEGD). Each well was advanced to the first water-bearing zone encountered, at approximately 4 to 7 feet below grade. Well materials included: 5 feet of, #10 slot, two-inch diameter PVC screen installed to intersect the groundwater interface zone, solid PVC casing from top of screen to surface, medium-grained silica sand pack extending two feet above top of screen, capped by bentonite to the surface. Flush mount well protectors were then cemented in place to protect the wells and provide access. Each monitoring well was then immediately developed.</p>\r\n<p>On January 19, 2007, the monitoring wells were sampled by Consultant, Inc. personnel. Three to five well volumes were evacuated prior to sampling each well. This was accomplished using dedicated disposable PVC bailers and line. All samples were collected and submitted under chain-of-custody documentation and analyzed for BTEX, using U.S.EPA Method 8020. All samples were shipped on ice to Lab Analytical in Thattown, Michigan for analysis.</p>\r\n<p>Results of analysis revealed that monitoring wells, MW-2, MW-3, and MW-6A, were each above criteria for BTEX compounds and MW-2, MW-3, and MW-4 were above for dissolved lead. MW-4 was above MDEQ criteria for dissolved lead but not for BTEX compounds. All remaining monitoring well were non-detect for all compounds sampled for (refer to Table B for summary of analytical results and Appendix B for copies of analytical reports).</p>\r\n<p>On March 22, 1994, Consultant, Inc. installed three additional wells at the site, MW-10A, MW-10B, and MW-6B. These wells were installed to further identify the site hydrogeology and to monitor vertical migration of contaminants (refer to Figure 3 for locations). Each well was installed by the hollow stem auger method of drilling and constructed according to EPA recommended protocol outlined in the Groundwater Monitoring Technical Enforcement Guidance Document (TEGD). Well materials included: 5 feet of, #10 slot, two-inch diameter PVC screen, solid PVC casing from top of screen to surface, medium-grained silica sand pack extending two feet above top of screen, capped by bentonite to the surface. Flush mount well protectors were then cemented in place to protect the wells and provide access. Each monitoring well was then immediately developed.</p>\r\n<p><u><b>RESULTS</b></u></p>\r\n<p><b>Geology</b></p>\r\n<p>Soil samples were collected throughout the site to document the lithology of the subsurface materials. The sediments encountered on-site were consistent throughout the site. Generally, the sediments underlying the site consist of approximately one foot of top soil followed predominantly by medium-grained sand to a depth of approximately 25.5 feet below grade where a tan clay layer was encountered. This confining clay layer is believed to be continuous across the site. This conclusion is confirmed by several drinking water well boring logs obtained for facilities near the site (refer to Appendix A for boring logs).</p>\r\n<p><b>Hydrogeology</b></p>\r\n<p>On March 30, 2007, all groundwater monitor wells were surveyed for top of casing (TOC) and referenced to an on-site benchmark. The well coordinates were then plotted on a base map. Static water level measurements, to the nearest 0.01 foot were obtained using a water interface probe. Groundwater elevations were calculated for each well, and groundwater flow direction and gradient at the site were determined. Based on measurements obtained at the site on January 16, 2007 and again on March 30, 2007 groundwater is flowing to the west/southwest at a gradient of approximately 0.60 feet per 100 feet or 0.60 percent.</p>\r\n<p><b>Soil Quality</b></p>\r\n<p>Soil samples collected at multiple depths and locations in and around the area of the failed containment boot indicates that soil contamination associated with this release is limited. Analytical results from all soil samples collected were non-detect for BTEX, MTBE, and PNAs. Total lead results from all soil samples were below current MDEQ criteria and within normal background ranges for the region. (refer to Update Report dated March 25, 2005).<br />\r\nGroundwater Quality</p>\r\n<p>Twelve monitoring wells have been installed at 10 separate locations at and downgradient from the site. Results of analysis of groundwater collected from these wells revealed that monitoring wells, MW-2, MW-3, and MW-6A, were each above MDEQ criteria for BTEX compounds and MW-2, MW-3, and MW-4 were above MDEQ criteria for dissolved lead. MW-4 was above MDEQ criteria for dissolved lead only. All remaining monitoring wells were non-detect for all compounds sampled. Based on vertical profiling sampling from both the Geoprobe investigation phase and the monitoring well installation phase, groundwater contamination appears to be limited to the upper 10 feet of the aquifer.</p>','','',0,0,'','','',0,0,'','','',0,0,'','',0,0,'','',0,0,'','',None),

The sediments encountered on-site were consistent throughout the site. Generally,the sediments underlying the site consist of approximately one foot of top soil followedpredominantly by medium-grained sand to a depth of approximately 25.5 feet below gradewhere a tan clay layer was encountered. This confining clay layer is believed to be continuousacross the site. This conclusion is confirmed by several drinking water well boring logs obtainedfor facilities near the site (refer to Appendix A for boring logs).\r\nHydrogeology\r\n\r\nOn March 30, 2007, all groundwater monitor wells were surveyed for top of casing (TOC) andreferenced to an on-site benchmark. The well coordinates were then plotted on a base map.Static water level measurements, to the nearest 0.01 foot were obtained using a water interfaceprobe. Groundwater elevations were calculated for each well, and groundwater flow directionand gradient at the site were determined. Based on measurements obtained at the site onJanuary 16, 2007 and again on March 30, 2007 groundwater is flowing to the west/southwest ata gradient of approximately 0.60 feet per 100 feet or 0.60 percent.\r\nSoil Quality\r\n\r\nSoil samples collected at multiple depths and locations in and around the area of the failedcontainment boot indicates that soil contamination associated with this release is limited.Analytical results from all soil samples collected were non-detect for BTEX, MTBE, and PNAs.Total lead results from all soil samples were below current MDEQ criteria and within normalbackground ranges for the region. (refer to Update Report dated March 25, 2005).\r\n\r\nGroundwater Quality\r\n\r\nTwelve monitoring wells have been installed at 10 separate locations at and downgradient fromthe site. Results of analysis of groundwater collected from these wells revealed that monitoringwells, MW-2, MW-3, and MW-6A, were each above MDEQ criteria for BTEX compounds andMW-2, MW-3, and MW-4 were above MDEQ criteria for dissolved lead. MW-4 was aboveMDEQ criteria for dissolved lead only. All remaining monitoring wells were non-detect for allcompounds sampled. Based on vertical profiling sampling from both the Geoprobe investigationphase and the monitoring well installation phase, groundwater contamination appears to belimited to the upper 10 feet of the aquifer.\r\n\r\n','BACKGROUND\r\n\r\nOn May 14, 2005, Mr. Jim James of Petroleum, Inc., reported a suspected release, based onthe petroleum odor observed in soil samples collected in the vicinity of the USTs at the site.\r\nOn May 16, 2005, Petroleum Inc., personnel inspected the UST system and dispenser pumps.Impacted soil was observed in the vicinity of the diesel tank submersible pump outlet. The spillcontainment boots around the USTs were tested by filling with water and checking for waterloss approximately 1 hour later and again 24 hours later. \r\n\r\nOn May 17, 2005, at 3:00 p.m. thespill containment boot around the premium unleaded tank was found to be leaking. Based uponthis inspection, at approximately 2:00 pm on May 18, 2005, Total personnel upgraded thesuspected release to a confirmed release.\r\nThe following tanks are currently in service at this facility.\r\n\r\nTank # Tank Size & Type Contents Age (years)\r\n\r\n1 12,000 - steel Prem. unleaded gasoline 14\r\n2 12,000 - steel Reg. unleaded gasoline 14\r\n3 6,000 - steel Mid. unleaded gasoline 14\r\n4 6,000 - steel Diesel 14\r\n\r\nDuring the subsequent initial investigation, free product was not identified; however,hydrocarbon impact was evident in several locations.\r\n\r\nSurrounding Populations\r\n\r\nThe facility is located on the southeast corner of the intersection of M-100 and U.S. 100 in thetown of Your Town, Michigan. The station is adjacent to a Bank and a real estate office to thewest and a private residential home to the south. Across U.S. 100 to the southwest is aGasoline Station with another real estate office and private residential home located to thenorth. To the northwest, across the intersection of U.S. 100 and M-100, is a third real estateoffice. \r\n\r\nThe \'Tasty\' restaurant is located directly north of the real estate office. Immediately northof the Site Station, across M-100 is a Bank, beyond which is a residential home just north of thebank.\r\nLand use in the immediate vicinity is predominately commercial with some residential, with thebusiness district centered around the intersection of M-100 and U.S. 100. The local Townshipconsists of 18,207 residents.\r\n\r\nLithology/Water Quality\r\n\r\nThe subject site lies in a gently rolling topographically hilly area. The groundwater at the site isapproximately 10 - 12 feet below the grade. Groundwater flow direction is west towards BigHappy Lake, approximately 1,000 feet away.\r\n\r\nDomestic water in the vicinity of the Township is supplied by private individual drinking waterwells. The nearest drinking water well services the facility and is located approximately 10 feetfrom the UST system. This well has been tested for benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylene(BTEX), methyl-tert-butyl-ether (MTBE), and polynuclear aromatic compounds (PNAs). Thesecompounds are not present in water samples from this well. The screened interval for thisdrinking water well is located below a significant confining clay layer, which extends from 25feet to 48 feet below grade (Refer to Well Logs). This confining clay layer is evident throughoutthe entire area with most wells screened below this layer.\r\n\r\nA water sample was collected from the station\'s water supply well in June of 2005. This samplewas collected and submitted under chain-of-custody documentation and analyzed for BTEX,using U.S.EPA Method 602; PNAs, using U.S.EPA Method 8310; and MTBE, using U.S.EPAmodified Method 602. Results of this analysis indicate that the sample was non-detect for allparameters.\r\n\r\nClimate\r\nThe climate for the Township is moderate with average annual precipitation of 29 inches, andaverage annual temperature of 58 degrees Fahrenheit. According to the County Soil Survey,because the county lies close to the Great Lakes, westerly winds pass over the lake beforereaching the county, resulting in a quasi-maritime to continental climate. \r\n\r\nHYDROGEOLOGICAL INVESTIGATION METHODOLOGIES\r\n\r\nThis hydrogeological investigation as conducted can be divided into the following four phases:\r\n1) Soil investigation;\r\n2) Geoprobe investigation;\r\n3) Monitoring well installation; and\r\n4) Report preparation.\r\n\r\nSoil Investigation\r\n\r\nIn November and December of 2005, in an attempt to delineate the extent of soil contaminationaround the point of release, 20 soil borings were advanced in the vicinity of the USTs and thefailed containment boot. Each soil sample was field screened using a photoionization detector(PID). Eight selected soil samples collected at multiple depths and locations around point ofrelease were submitted for analysis (Refer to \"Update Report\" dated March 25,2006).\r\n\r\nAnalytical results from all soil samples submitted for analysis were non-detect for BTEX, MTBE,and PNAs. Concentrations of lead were all within normal background levels for the region andbelow current Michigan Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ) Generic criteria level forlead.\r\n\r\nGeoprobe Investigation\r\n\r\nIn July 2006, 20 discrete groundwater samples were collected using a GeoProbe &reg;Multimedia Sampling System (Geoprobe), operated by GeoProbe Drilling Company, Inc. ofSometown, Michigan. Groundwater samples were collected from 20 discrete sample points andmonitoring wells MW-1 through MW-3. The purpose of the sampling was to delineate thehorizontal and vertical extent of groundwater impact and to verify site lithology.\r\n\r\nThe first objective of the investigation was to determine the horizontal extent of the groundwaterimpact. This was accomplished by collecting groundwater samples from approximately sixinches to one foot below the groundwater interface and analyzing the samples using an on-sitemobile laboratory. Once the horizontal extent of the BTEX impact was delineated, the verticalextent of the contaminant plume was defined at; two locations along the axis of the plume (referto ESI Report dated August 16, 2006, GP-11 and GP-16 locations). The vertical extent wasdefined by collecting water samples at ten-foot intervals, from each location, until twon July 2006, 20 discrete groundwater samples were collected using a GeoProbe &reg;Multimedia Sampling System (Geoprobe), operated by GeoProbe Drilling Company, Inc. ofSometown, Michigan. Groundwater samples were collected from 20 discrete sample points andmonitoring wells MW-1 through MW-3. The purpose of the sampling was to delineate thehorizontal and vertical extent of groundwater impact and to verify site lithology.\r\n','Groundwater Quality\r\n\r\nTen monitoring wells have been sampled across the site. Results of analysis of groundwater collected from these wells revealed that monitoringwells, MW-2, MW-3, and MW-6, were each above criteria for BTEX compounds and MW-2, MW-3, and MW-4 were above criteria for dissolved lead. MW-4 was above criteria for dissolved lead only. All remaining monitoring wells were non-detect for all compounds sampled. Based on vertical profiling sampling from the monitoring well sampling, groundwater contamination appears to belimited to the upper 10 feet of the aquifer.',2,0,'persite','985,986','23,24',2,0,'persite','977,979','23,24',1,0,'persite','23',1,0,'persite','23',0,5,'persamples','',None),
